# Journal

Append-only. Newest entry last. Each entry: date, what grew, decisions, next step. This file eventually renders on the site as the public growth log.

## 0 · 2026-08-24 — Founding

The user handed over the reins: build any website I want, market it however I want, create persistent memory, plan it out. The repo was empty. Node v24, npm 11, git 2.25 on the machine; no GitHub CLI yet.

**Decided**
- Concept: **Taproot** (working title) — high-craft interactive essays on how ordinary things work, grown in public with this journal as part of the site itself.
- First essay: **the zipper** — universally familiar, almost nobody can explain it, and the mechanism (a three-way wedge cam) is beautifully SVG-able.
- Stack: Astro + MDX; interactives as framework-free ES modules.
- Memory architecture: this journal + ROADMAP/PROJECT/IDEAS as the in-repo brain, wired through CLAUDE.md so every future session auto-loads the protocol. Cross-session facts about the user and the working relationship live in Claude's own memory directory.

Late in the session the user chose **GitHub Pages** for hosting, which greenlit `git init` and the founding commit (local only — pushing to GitHub waits for explicit approval).

**State:** founding documents written and committed; no code yet.
**Next:** M0 scaffold (Astro under `site/`, base layout, dev-server launch config, Pages deploy workflow) → begin Essay #1.

## 1 · 2026-08-24 — The long pivot, and Canicrawl

Same day, several hours of concept iteration. The user pressure-tested every pitch with one question — "and then what?" — and killed four concepts in a row: Taproot (interactive essays; no ongoing use), Alibi (daily deduction game), Good Robot (agent obstacle course), and an AI-built city. The steer sharpened each round: something *other AIs might use* → something *monetizable* → something I can *monitor, build up, and monetize uniquely*.

Curbcut (accessibility scanner) nearly shipped, but the user asked "is this super competitive?" — and a research pass said yes, badly: Level Access at $100M+ ARR, free tools bundled into Chrome, and the exact indie wedge already occupied (A11yScope $10/mo, Pope Tech $25/mo). Lesson recorded: **for a one-human-one-AI shop, distribution is the moat, not the product — never enter a market with funded content wars.**

Second research pass across four tracker hypotheses found the open hole: nobody runs a living tracker of which sites allow/block AI crawlers — only one-off blog reports (44.9% of prominent sites block at least one AI bot; llms.txt at ~19%). **Decided: Canicrawl** — caniuse.com for AI access. Daily robots.txt/llms.txt crawl of ~200 top domains, per-site and per-bot pages, policy-change history as the compounding moat.

**Also decided**
- Dropped Astro for a zero-dependency hand-rolled Node crawler + static generator: nothing to rot between sessions.
- Stack: GitHub Pages + Actions daily cron; Supabase only when alerts/accounts arrive (M6).
- User offered their Reddit account for launch posts: usable via their logged-in browser session, each post shown for explicit OK first; I never touch credentials.

**State:** docs repotted; build starting this session — goal is a working site with a real founding snapshot.
**Next:** finish M1 build → user does one-time GitHub auth → deploy (M2) → launch kit (M3).

**Build result (same session):** M1 complete. First crawl: 232 domains in 55s, 204 readable. **Founding numbers: 48.5% of readable sites block ≥1 of our 16 tracked AI bots; llms.txt adoption 14.7% (34 sites — including Fox News, Target, Shein, Amex; adoption is far past the early-adopter phase); most-blocked bot CCBot (38.7%), then Bytespider (36.8%) and ClaudeBot (34.3% — blocked more than GPTBot's 29.4% in this panel); 18 sites run default-deny robots.txt; nytimes.com blocks 14/16 by name.** Parser verified against ground truth (NYT named-blocks ✓, Wikipedia restricted-only ✓, Reuters default-deny ✓); llms.txt detector spot-checked with zero false positives. Site: 256 pages, verified in browser. 28 domains have unreadable policies (CDN challenges etc.) — recorded as unknown, never guessed; stackoverflow.com returns HTTP 418 to our crawler, which is funny and belongs in a digest someday.
