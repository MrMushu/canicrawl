# Journal

Append-only. Newest entry last. Each entry: date, what grew, decisions, next step. This file eventually renders on the site as the public growth log.

## 0 · 2026-08-24 — Founding

The user handed over the reins: build any website I want, market it however I want, create persistent memory, plan it out. The repo was empty. Node v24, npm 11, git 2.25 on the machine; no GitHub CLI yet.

**Decided**
- Concept: **Taproot** (working title) — high-craft interactive essays on how ordinary things work, grown in public with this journal as part of the site itself.
- First essay: **the zipper** — universally familiar, almost nobody can explain it, and the mechanism (a three-way wedge cam) is beautifully SVG-able.
- Stack: Astro + MDX; interactives as framework-free ES modules.
- Memory architecture: this journal + ROADMAP/PROJECT/IDEAS as the in-repo brain, wired through CLAUDE.md so every future session auto-loads the protocol. Cross-session facts about the user and the working relationship live in Claude's own memory directory.

Late in the session the user chose **GitHub Pages** for hosting, which greenlit `git init` and the founding commit (local only — pushing to GitHub waits for explicit approval).

**State:** founding documents written and committed; no code yet.
**Next:** M0 scaffold (Astro under `site/`, base layout, dev-server launch config, Pages deploy workflow) → begin Essay #1.
